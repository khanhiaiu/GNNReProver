## Overview

Premise selection is a bottleneck for scaling theorem proving in large formal libraries. Existing language-based methods often treat premises in isolation, ignoring the web of dependencies connecting them.

We present a graph-augmented approach that combines:
1.  **Dense text embeddings** of Lean formalizations.
2.  **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** over a heterogeneous dependency graph (capturing state–premise and premise–premise relations).

On the **LeanDojo Benchmark**, our method outperforms the ReProver baseline by over **25%** across standard retrieval metrics, demonstrating the value of relational information in theorem proving.
